# Dockerfile
# This is an example of a custom Dockerfile if you need to extend the base Node-RED image.

# Use the official Node-RED image as a base
FROM nodered/node-red:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/node-red

# You can pre-install nodes here. For example, to install the Snowflake node:
# RUN npm install node-red-contrib-snowflake

# You can also copy a custom settings file.
# COPY settings.js .

# The base image already exposes port 1880 and sets the correct CMD.
