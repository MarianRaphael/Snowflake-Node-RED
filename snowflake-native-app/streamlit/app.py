## Node-RED for Snowflake Native App

This Snowflake Native App provides a launcher and management interface for a Node-RED instance running within Snowpark Container Services.

### Overview

* **Launcher UI:** A simple Streamlit interface to launch the Node-RED editor.
* **Custom Nodes:** The Node-RED instance is pre-packaged with custom nodes for seamless integration with Snowflake.
* **Secure:** Everything runs inside your Snowflake account, ensuring your data never leaves your security boundary.

### Installation

1.  Install the app from the Snowflake Marketplace.
2.  Grant the `app_public` role to the Snowflake users who need access.
3.  Open the app in Snowsight to launch Node-RED.
